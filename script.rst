I have a pet called Bobby

He is a human too

You would have a lot in common

Because you are a human too

And you have the same name

Bobby liked to CONSUME NEUTRIENTS, INTAKE ATMOSPHERIC GASSES and MAKE NOISES WITH OTHER HUMANS.

Do you like to CONSUME NEUTRIENTS, INTAKE ATMOSPHERIC GASSES and MAKE NOISES WITH OTHER HUMANS?
